# Welcome to Terra Inco Gnito. 

This site will be rambling about how reality mixes far to much whit a distopic fiction more and more. 

We can't know all that is true. And this one simple fact makes our view of the world distorted. 
Lacking. Wrong. False. 
But our mind can't "bear the thought" of a lacking knowledge and will always give us an answer. 
-- Or at the least, the feeling we have an anwer. --
Even one that is stupid if we think 2 seconds about it. 
And this feeling makes our world view in and by itself overconfident.

# Ways our mind turns on us

## Blindspots: limitations of our senses

### **Vision** the actual blindspot, narrow frequency range and it's consequences 
### **Olfaction** A limited number of receptors for an infinity of molecules
### **Touch** When hands and feet are much more sensitive than bottoms and backs
### **Earing** Vibration perception only in a (very) limited frequency 
### **Proprioception** When the self is it's own mostly ignored sense.

## Thinking processes 

1. The Slow / analytic 
2. The Fast / intuitive

### Biases that derives from them 

## **knowledge** Limitations on models  and data
## **testimony** Limitations due to believing testimony over real data study*
## history interpretation from the future fallacy : the bias of back propagation (not what it's usually called), 
of seeing patterns where there are none, and o course of believing "we/I could have done better".
